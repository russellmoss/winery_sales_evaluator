      "weight": 8,
      "score": 2,
      "weightedScore": 16,
      "notes": "Russell provided only a basic greeting ('hi my name is Russell and I'm going to be taking care of you today is this your first time at Malaya') without warmth or enthusiasm. The greeting lacked personalization and did not create an exciting first impression."

      "criterion": "Building Rapport",
      "weight": 10,
      "score": 3,
      "weightedScore": 30,
      "notes": "Russell did ask where guests were from early in the conversation (message 3), which was positive, and made a comment about Pleasant Valley being historic. However, he didn't follow up on their comments about being excited to visit or ask deeper personal questions to establish meaningful connection."

      "weight": 10,
      "score": 2,
      "weightedScore": 20,
      "notes": "Russell mostly referred guests to the menu for winery history rather than sharing compelling stories. He briefly mentioned the Vincenza wine being named after Barry Milea's mother but provided minimal information about the winery's founding, values, or philosophy."

      "criterion": "Storytelling and Analogies",
      "weight": 10,
      "score": 2,
      "weightedScore": 20,
      "notes": "Russell's descriptions were primarily factual with minimal storytelling or analogies. When describing wines, he offered basic flavor notes ('cherries, graphite') but didn't use rich comparisons or memorable narratives to bring the wines to life beyond mentioning Vincenza was named after the owner's mother."

      "criterion": "Recognition of Buying Signals",
      "weight": 12,
      "score": 2,
      "weightedScore": 24,
      "notes": "Russell missed several clear buying signals. The guests repeatedly expressed enthusiasm about wines, mentioned taking bottles home, and even explicitly stated 'Maybe we should join the wine club' (message 20), but Russell never followed up on these opportunities, instead just bringing the check (message 19)."

      "weight": 8,
      "score": 2,
      "weightedScore": 16,
      "notes": "Russell mentioned the QR code for the giveaway early but did not attempt to collect customer information throughout the interaction. Despite the guests' expressed interest in wines and even mentioning the wine club, he made no efforts to capture their contact information."

      "criterion": "Asking for the Sale",
      "weight": 12,
      "score": 1,
      "weightedScore": 12,
      "notes": "Russell never directly asked for a sale throughout the entire interaction. Despite guests expressing interest in purchasing wine and joining the wine club, he did not capitalize on these opportunities, merely stating he would 'have your check be ready to check out' at the end."

      "score": 3,
      "weightedScore": 30,
      "notes": "Russell recommended the tasting flight as appropriate for first-time visitors, which showed some personalization. He also shared his personal favorite (Vincenza) but didn't tailor specific bottle recommendations based on guests' reactions and preferences to the wines they tasted."

      "criterion": "Wine Club Presentation",
      "weight": 12,
      "score": 1,
      "weightedScore": 12,
      "notes": "Russell made no mention of the wine club despite the guests twice mentioning interest in joining (messages 12 and 20). This was a significant missed opportunity as the guests directly stated 'Maybe we should join the wine club so we can secure an allocation!'"

      "weight": 8,
      "score": 3,
      "weightedScore": 24,
      "notes": "Russell's closing was basic and transactional, simply stating 'when I come back I will have your check be ready to check out.' He didn't thank the guests for their visit, acknowledge their enthusiasm, or specifically encourage them to return in the future."
